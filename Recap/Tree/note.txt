node from height ?>>>

if height =h the max number of node is 2^(h+1) -1
if height =h the min number of node is h+1

at level h the max node at that level is 2^h


height from node ?>>>

if max node is n then n = 2^(h+1) -1
if we do calculation  h = log (n+1) -1

if min nodes is n then n=h+1
if we do calculation   h=n-1

(if max nodes are gives then the height is minimun)
(if min nodes are given then the height is maximum)



?>>> Types of binary tree

1. FULL/Proper /strict - 
    if the tree contains either 0 or 2 leanodes

    no of leaf nodes = number of internal nodes +1
2. Complete binary -
    all the level are completely filled (except possibly the last level the last level)
    and if the last level shoul have children from left to right filled
    it coluld have either one or two but it should fill from let to right
    sometimes the hald filed leaf also called  NEARLY FILLED BINARY TREE
